## Prerequisites
1. [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/resources/create-account/)
2. [A user with AdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) to your account to provision AWS resources for you like S3 Bucket, ApiGateway, Cloudfront, DynamoDB, Cognito, ETC.
3. [Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) - Please refer to the link to set the credentials on your computer.
4. [Install AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)

## Quick Start
1. ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/subtitle-generator-cdk-app
   $ cd subtitle-generator-cdk-app
   $ npm install
   $ npm run build
   $ cdk bootstrap
   $ cdk deploy --all --outputs-file ./cdk-outputs.json
   ```
   <b>Please check for each stack provisioned through the terminal and type `y` to the question.</b><br>
   Through this task, provision the architecture shown in the figure above. It takes approximately 15-30 minutes.
2. After the entire stack is deployed, check the `cdk-outputs.json` file and access the `StaticWebDistributionUrl` in `StaticWebStack` through your browser.<br>
   (Ex: `"StaticWebDistributionUrl": "xxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net"`)
3. And copy the entire contents of `cdk-outputs.json` to the clipboard.
